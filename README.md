# segm_depth_network
The mutli-task work of &lt;Monocular Outdoor Semantic Mapping with a Multi-task Network>

The repo is the multi-network part of <Monocular Outdoor Semantic Mapping with a Multi-task Network>
You can use `python train --device 0 --dataset cs --ratio 0.85` to start your code journey

`--device` is to choose your GPU ID
`--data` is to choose your dataset, 'cs' or 'kitti'
`--ratio` is to choose the ratio between depth and semantic segmantation in loss function.

Enjoy
